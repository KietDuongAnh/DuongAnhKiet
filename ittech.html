      <p>The IT world is experiencing a number of remarkable developments, some of which may fade into obscurity, but some of which are likely to have a profound impact on how we live our lives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud Computing are two of the most important ones we need to consider. In addition, these technologies are both relevant to my project.</p>
      <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</b></h1>
      <hr style="border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
        <p>“Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.” (How Artificial Intelligence Works, 2021)[2]. In short, as a broad field of computer science, artificial intelligence (AI) aims to give machines the capabilities to accomplish tasks that normally require human intellectual capacity.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">State of the art of AI</h1>
      <p><b>Machine learning (ML):</b></p>
        <p >Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses analytic techniques to give machines the ability to handle data without specific instructions. It is possible for systems, in particular, to learn from statistics, recognize patterns, and make decisions with limited human involvement. Machine learning today is more powerful due to more advanced computing technologies. In the past, it grew out of pattern recognition and the concept that computers can learn without being programmed to do specific tasks. As a result of iterative nature, computers are able to learn from supplied data and use them to make decisions to independently adapt. Machine learning has become more popular in modern society due to algorithms that allow computers to perform more sophisticated calculations on big data and run faster than ever before. For example, we can see its application in Netflix's online suggestion promotions or self-driving car supported by Google.</p>
        <p><b>Deep learning (DL):</b></p>
          <p >“Deep learning takes inspiration from the activity of neurons within the brain to learn how to recognize complex patterns through learned data. This is thanks to the use of algorithms, mainly statistical calculations. The word ‘deep’ refers to the large number of levels of neurons that ML models simultaneously, which helps acquire rich representations of data to obtain performance gains.” (Artificial Intelligence: state of the art - Thinkopen, 2021)[3]. Specifically, deep learning employs massive neural networks with lots of layers of processors to learn complicated patterns in huge amounts of data, taking advantage of modern in computing power and enhanced training methods. In today’s world, deep learning application has evolved significantly, especially in human-to-machine interaction. Gesture, touch and voice recognition technology, for example, is replacing the mouse and the keyboard in computers.</p>
        <p><b>Natural Language Processing (NPL):</b></p>
          <p >“Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding.”(What is Natural Language Processing?, 2021)[4]. Accordingly, natural language processing refers to the capacity of computers to analysis, comprehend, and produce human language, including speech. Natural language processing encompasses a wide range of techniques for translating human language. NLP tasks, in general, decompose language into smaller pieces, attempt to understand relationships between the parts, and investigate how the pieces come together to produce meaning. In practice, there are many NPL applications that are used but we may not recognize. For example, when we traverse a website by using its constructed search engine or by picking a recommended topic, we have used NLP techniques for search and content classification.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">Why is it important?</h1>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
           <li > <b>Learning by repetition:</b> AI performs a large number of tasks. By virtue of its recursive nature, artificial intelligence (AI) is able to discover through data reliably without tiredness.</li>
           <li ><b>Adaptation:</b> Artificial intelligence (AI) adapts through the use of progressive learning algorithms. AI identifies patterns, structure in data so that algorithms can learn by itself, and adapt when given new data. </li>
           <li ><b>More accuracy and deeper analyzing:</b> Deep learning models are taught to learn directly from data. As a result of today's incredible computing power and big data, AI can analyze deeper data using multi-layered neural networks with incredible accuracy.</li>
           <li ><b>Integration of AI in products:</b> AI enhances the intelligence of existing products. Many of the products we use have been enhanced with AI capabilities, similar to how Siri was added as a feature to Apple products. Furthermore, bots and intelligent systems are now being combined with massive amounts of data to improve a wide range of technologies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">Development in the future</h1>
      <p><b>Integration of Afitificial Intelligence and Internet of Things</b></p>
        <p >Internet of Things may eventually merge with AI
           technology in the future. In particular, AI can be used in an IoT platform
           for use situations such as problem analysis, diagnostic machine maintenance,
           or exception identification. This data is collected by devices such as cameras,
           microphones, and other sensors from input images, voice recognition, or any other
           medium. It is then trained in a cloud environment using advanced machine learning -
           based technologies. In fact, the above predictions are possible because AI technology
           is constantly developing with the support from other enhancement. Advanced algorithms,
           for example, are being formed and integrated in novel methods to deal with data more quickly
           and enable AI systems work efficiently.</p>
      <p><b>Afitificial Intelligence in Cloud</b></p>
        <p >The incorporation of AI and Cloud Computing may
          assist AI systems in accessing data from the cloud, training themselves, and
          adapting new insights into the cloud. As a result, other AI systems can also
          benefit from these new data. This fusion improves computation strength as well
          as the ability to handle large amounts of data and intelligence. Today, the
          availability of data has been increasing and is expected to continue, so data
          storage capability has been enhancing. This open up opportunities as well as
          necessitate the AI development to meet the users demand in the future</p>

      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">The impact of AI</h1>
      <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-blue">Positive impacts</p>
        <p ><b>Financial service:</b> AI techniques can be
          utilized in financial firms, like bank for example, to define which transactions
          are prone to fraud by using fast and accurate credit reporting and automate data
          management tasks. As a result, it helps speed up, improve precision, and enhance the
          efficiency of human work. AI also enable virtual shopping by making product suggestions
          and discussing options to buy with the customer. AI also works on improving
          stock management technologies.</p>
        <p ><b>Autonomous vehicles:</b> Self-driving cars
          are completely integrated into AI systems, allowing them to work automatically
          while comprehending the surroundings and actual circumstance of the environment.</p>
        <p ><b>Improving productivity:</b> Artificial intelligence
          (AI) has the potential to improve workplace efficiency and elevate human capabilities.
          Humans are better suited to creative and empathic work when AI can automates their
          repetitive or dangerous jobs. People"s success and career progression could increase
          if they are doing work that they enjoy. Moreover, AI functions such as automation,
          fraud checking and suggestion can help people perform their tasks better. This is most
          effective with people who regular deal with manual work like blue-collar workers.</p>
        <p ><b>Better healthcare:</b> Another class of society who
          can experience the benefits of AI is patient. AI can reduce costs and save
          money by improving the efficiency of medical systems. Potential for personalized
          treatment plans and drug procedures have a profound impact on the quality of
          life for millions of patients. AI machines can analyze data, make a diagnosis,
          and predict variety of diseases. Moreover, they can monitor medical conditions
          of patients, and assist scientists in medicine development as well as prevent
          health problems. Application of AI can provide precision medicine and X-ray
          measurement. Aside from that, AI personal assistants can remind us to stay
          healthy, just like live coaches can do.</p>
        <p ><b>Enhancing security:</b> Our ability to detect
          and solve crimes will be improved thanks to artificial intelligence. To
          illustrate, face detection and biometric systems aid in the tracking of humans.
          To keep cities and environment safe, security cameras and other tracking
          devices are widely used. Biometric technology are becoming increasingly common
          along with fingerprints. The use of AI in the judicial system also creates many
          opportunities to discover how to use the technology effectively without invading
          a person"s private space.</p>

      <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-blue">Negative impacts</p>
        <p ><b>Unemployment:</b> AI-based machines may replace
          many jobs. For example, couriers may gradually be completely replaced by
          autonomous vehicles in the transportation industry in the future. Another
          instance the development of smart agriculture. In farming, robotics and AI
          technologies are already being used. In the future, a management system may
          soon be able to run entire businesses fully autonomous via a range of interconnected
          devices using AI technology instead of farmers. Also, there are more jobs
          will be replaced such as assembly line workers or customer service assistants
          and so on.</p>
        <p ><b>Fake news:</b> Neuronal networks have the ability
          to produce realistic images or to copy a human voice, which has the potential
          to cause massive social disruption. Worries are also being raised about how
          technologies will be used to manipulate someone images for malicious
          purposes.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">How it affects me ?</h1>
        <p >Firstly, AI technology applications have great
         impact on my life. It opens up many opportunities for me to enhance learning
         with the support of AI. Specifically, AI provides me with the ability to handle
         wide range of languages and enhance my creativity. For example, I can use
         mobile application to learn a new language efficiently with AI digital
         assistant support. Moreover, AI has problem-solving abilities, which have
         made a significant contribution to my learning process. The intelligence
         utilizes methods and historical data to create algorithms capable of detecting
         and reducing errors and making useful recommendations to find a good solution.
         As a student, researching and analyzing are indispensable things for me.
         With the help of web search engines to optimally use the source of data,
         my learning efficiency will be improved significantly. Furthermore, AI
         also play a vital role in improving life experience. For example, digital
         assistants helps to perform my daily task more effectively. They are
         beneficial in a wide variety of purposes such as internet searching, text
         dictation, reminders, scheduling and so on. So far, if I can use this technology
         in right way, my life will be change in a positive direction. In particular,
         it will change the way I communicate because the language barrier is no more
         a problem. I may communicate and interact with more friends using different
         language. Furthermore, the autonomous nature of AI systems will help to
         perform tasks on my behalf and change my working style. However, if I
         misuse and become too dependent on it, I will lose my assertiveness and
         independence. That why I should gain a basic knowledge about AI before
         using it.</p>
         <p >Aside from that, AI technology has a direct impact
          on society around me as well. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now associated
          with the Internet of Things (IoT), which creates flexible ecosystems. My family
          can make use of a network of connected devices to ensure security, enjoy new
          experiences of smart home, and so on. In addition, my friends are able to
          communicate more easily with one another or even with global community thanks
          to the AI language support.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>CLOUD COMPUTING</b></h1>
      <hr style="border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">What is Cloud Computing?</h1>
      <p > “Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.” (What Is Cloud Computing? A Beginner’s Guide | Microsoft Azure, 2021) [5]. Cloud computing refers to the Internet-based delivery of a wide range of IT resources. Data storage, software, databases, and other computing resources are hosted at a remote server managed by a cloud services provider.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">State of the art of Cloud computing service</h1>
      <p>In general, the structure of cloud computing service can be commonly divided into 3 layer: software layer, platform layer and infrastructure layer.</p>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KietDuongAnh/DuongAnhKiet/main/images/CloudService.png" alt="ServiceModel" style="width:50%">

      <p><b>Software as a service (SaaS):</b></p>
        <p >“Software as a service (SaaS) replaces the traditional on-device software with software that is licensed on a subscription basis. It is centrally hosted in the cloud.” (The Top 3 Cloud Computing Service Models, 2021) [6]. To be more specific, as a result of the SaaS, consumers can use applications that are hosted on a cloud infrastructure. It is possible to access the applications from a wide range of client devices, and the user is not in control of the cloud infrastructure. Cloud applications can take advantage of the automatic feature to achieve higher performance, accessibility, and reduced costs, which make cloud apps more convenient than the traditional ones. In addition, SaaS also provides customers a pay-as-you-go approach that means customers just pay for what they needs. This allows users to measure their application services as needed. In fact, we have already been using many SaaS approaches today without realization. Most SaaS apps, such as Facebook, YouTube, email, and Google apps, can be accessed immediately via a web browser, without the need to download or install them.</p>
      <p><b>Platform as a service (PaaS): </b></p>
        <p >The platform layer, which is on the top of the infrastructure layer, is made up of application frameworks. “PaaS provides the ability to create and manage custom cloud applications. It enables users to deploy their created or acquired applications using programming languages, frameworks and tools that are provided by the cloud host. The user doesn't manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure (networks, servers, operating systems and storage), but does have control over deployed applications and possibly the application-hosting configurations.” (Cloud Computing - What it is and why it matters, 2021) [7]. Developers can build, manage and deploy their applications by using framework, programming languages and other supports from the cloud center. The platform layer's aim is to limit the burden of directly deploying applications. Developers can focus less on management and more on coding and application development. In practice, PaaS can simplify building process and speed up deployment, for example, Google App Engine offers API support for faster operating databases and storage of a website.</p>
      <p><b>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):</b></p>
        <p >IaaS is the highest as well as the most basic level of the hierarchical model providing computing resources. “These can include storage, networks, processing and other general computing resources. The IaaS user can run software from the cloud; access operating systems, applications and frameworks; and perform the general administrative functions; but does not manage or control the underlying infrastructure.” (Cloud Computing - What it is and why it matters, 2021) [8]. IaaS is a crucial component as a pool to store data and other resources. This also makes it easy for businesses to append, remove, or modify IT infrastructure on the fly. Today, IaaS is becoming more popular among IT organizations because companies only pay for what they use when purchase IaaS instead of hardware. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">Why is it important?</h1>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
           <li > <b>Infrastructure:</b>The cloud allows users to share infrastructure as well as other resources, saving their time and money.</li>
           <li ><b>Scalability:</b> As needed, computing resources can be increased or decreased to improve processing or to store more cloud data.</li>
           <li ><b>Automation:</b> Upgrades or version configurations can be managed more efficiently through automation Upgrades or version configurations can be managed more efficiently through automation</li>
           <li ><b>Mobility:</b> To boost the efficiency of an mobile workforce, users can access information from the cloud through web browsers at any time and from anywhere.</li>
           <li ><b>collaboration:</b> In the cloud, users can share documents, data to reduce governance concerns related to platform connectivity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">Development in the future</h1>
      <p><b>Cloud Computing along with Internet of Things</b></p>
      <p >It is no surprise that companies are now promoting the use of IoT in every aspect of their business. In the Internet of Things, we are all connected to a network and are able to exchange information using any device that is connected to it. As a result of the high speed, performance, and flexibility, IoT devices can benefit from cloud computing. Aside from that, they offer enough storage space for users to keep their data secure, identify resources, and share information. Because of this benefit, the integration of IoT and Cloud computing may be applied widely in the future and become a standard in business. </p>
      <p><b>Increasing of data storage capability</b></p>
      <p >Data is being generated at an alarming rate today, and it is hard to handle it safely and securely. “Statistics on big data generation show that 2.3 trillion gigabytes of data are created every day, and 40 zettabytes of data will be created by 2020” (Team, 2021) [9]. In most cases, companies need a secure location to store their data. Due to intense competition, it is predicted that cloud providers will be able to offer more data centers at a lower cost. Handling with more data in the future is possible for cloud computing because of other technology supporting. For example, the ability to analyze data of AI technology can be beneficial to help cloud computing increase productivity when deal with data.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">The impact of Could Computing</h1>
      <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-blue">Positive impacts</p>
      <p ><b>Healthcare:</b> To ensure the proper treatment, the healthcare industry must place a high priority on patient safety, security, and privacy. As a result, cloud services are currently being applied to client data. Furthermore, by using remote monitoring technologies, doctors can better connect with their patients and collaborate with one another.</p>
      <p ><b>Finance:</b> When it comes to finance, cloud computing has a wide range of tools to support. Currently, many banks are using SaaS applications to help them keep track of their records and handle other back office tasks. Furthermore, cloud computing is used to ensure the security of daily transaction data and client data stored on the server.</p>
      <p ><b>Education:</b> Cloud-based solutions are be used by educational institutions to benefit both their employees and their students. Cloud solutions enable IT departments to keep student data safe and secure while remaining compliant with a variety of regulations. The cloud also promotes environments for all students by allowing them to access the collaborative application or service and interact with one another.</p>
      <p ><b>Employment:</b> Despite the fact that cloud computing allows for remote network management, cloud providers will always require IT personnel to maintain data regulation and distribution. As software must be upgraded and maintained on a regular basis, there will always be a need for software developers. IT project managers manage data systems at cloud computing companies, so they also must be kept employed.</p>
      <p ><b>manufactoring:</b> Manufacturing companies can use cloud solutions for every stage of the manufacturing process. In fact, they can easily access larger amounts of data and insights with suppliers and distributors thanks to cloud computing.</p>

      <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-blue">Negative impacts</p>
      <p ><b>Security:</b> It is difficult to continuously adjust the safety and functionality of your data and networks when they are stored and run in the cloud. And, with hackers constantly on the lookout for loose ends, it's critical to know that our cloud provider is protecting all of your data. Because of the cloud's vulnerability, users are hesitant to adopt it.</p>
      <p ><b>Ethics in the cloud:</b> Informed and personalized decisions are possible with the use of data, but there are ethical concerns. In cloud environment storages, massive amounts of consumer data are being collected for multiple purposes. Although data storage involves inherent security and privacy risks for users, the bigger issue may be who decides how to use the data. As a result, when decisions are made by machine learning or other related systems, they can affect and even exaggerate biases of the people who built these systems for financial or other purposes.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red">How it affects me?</h1>
      <p >Cloud computing has a significant impact on various aspects of my life. Firstly, cloud technology has reinforced its benefits in the field of education. To illustrate, it enable me to access data from everywhere at any time. I can enroll remotely and take part in many online activities as well as communities of my school. Furthermore, cloud storage give me the ability to store data in cloud space like Google Drive, for example.  The most effective is the on-demand approach. As a result, I actually pay for what I use by using online services instead of installing sophisticated infrastructure. Secondly, cloud computing also has great effects on my social life. It helps enhance closer relationship among people. The big living proof of that is the flexibility and mobility benefits of cloud make me as well as others connect to all corners of the world. I can look for new international friends via online communities such as discussion forums or playing video games. Due to the fact that cloud computing technology is increasingly develop, my life will also be affected by its trend in the future. It may also become a standard for all aspects of my life, not only a suggestion. For example, my personal data will be stored in cloud space for online services such as shopping and banking, instead of using traditional methods. Aside from that, people surrounding me also experience cloud benefits. Cloud computing might become more popular and shape the ways we live and work. I can share data with other friends and work together by using cloud-based application like Google Doc, for example. In addition, with the support of other technologies such as machine learning and IoT, our daily tasks might be improved and the communication would be enhanced.</p>
