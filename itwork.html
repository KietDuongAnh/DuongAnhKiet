    <hr style="border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>We were fortunate to have the opportunity to interview Mr. Tam, a software developer who is currently working on a project team for a Vietnamese technology company. His company mainly develops IT healthcare services and distributes medical equipment. His firm's existing partner is GE Healthcare, a company based in the United States that supplies medical equipment and IT healthcare systems. The team is currently working on a storage and communication system project for healthcare in Vietnam. This application's clients are primarily hospitals and clinics across the country. His daily tasks include coding in order to build and develop software, as well as communicating with a large number of people, including his team members, project sponsors, and customers. Tam stated that he spends the majority of his time coding. Because of the effects of Covid-19, he must work from home. Every day at 8:30 a.m., he calls the group. They will confer in order to decide on the division of labor for each member. He will present a brief report on work progress to the project manager at the end of the day. He also sometimes has meetings with partners and investors to deliver his team project ideas. Tam indicated that his job presents some difficulties. First, working in the medical field necessitates a high level of data accuracy as well as responsibility. He must strike a reasonable balance between technical assurance and accuracy. Furthermore, despite a high salary and many company benefits, working as a software developer is a highly competitive job due to its constant development. That necessitates him working and studying more in order to continuously develop himself.</p>
