      <p> My project would be about a mobile phone application using AI technology to help users get organized stay on top of their work routines. Individuals can use this task management tool to turn complex tasks into manageable to-do lists by setting daily goals and breaking them down into smaller tasks. To avoid being distracted by too many tasks, users can also set priorities for the most important ones to be completed before moving on to others. It also allows users to set and change deadlines for their goals on a flexible schedule. Also, the application's measurement would be used to keep track of these goals' progress over time, and users can view regular reports using intuitive charts. Finally, to make this application more interesting and increase use motivation, I also add an achievement-recording feature for complete goals, so that users can share them with others.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Motivation</b></h1>
      <hr style="border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
        <p>The enhanced convenience and modernity of life means that the amount of human workload is constantly increasing. Therefore, the management of tasks is critical to the successful work. In fact, “Of the time given to a workday, 80% is spent doing tasks with little to no value and only 20% is spent doing something important” (Time Management Statistics and Facts That Will Surprise You - Trafft, 2021) [1]. As a result, we need suitable tasks management to avoid wasting time and optimize the productivity. Paper to-do lists are perfectly acceptable, but going digital has its advantages. A task can also be enhanced with the addition of notes, links, and files using these tools. This is my motivation to create this application. When building and developing this product, I always keep in mind three prerequisites: helping users get arranged, improving their working styles, and raising their focus. To-do list apps are available in a variety of forms today. While a number of these programs are widely used because of their intuitive user interfaces, others are valued for their powerful features. However, in this project, my product would strike a balance between straightforwardness and efficiency because I want it to appeal equally to novices and professionals.</p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Description</b></h1>
    <hr style="border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
      <p>First of all, to make an easy access, my product would be free for users to download and enjoy. This application is supported for both Android and IOS devices. It can also make profits from the premium version, which have enhanced features such as more reports, decorations and notification via emails. Moreover, I expect my application would be a harmonious blend of simple colors and a convenience of having because it is always beneficial to have a tool that is both visually appealing and simple to use.</p>
      <p>There are four core features that I want to focus on while developing this application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li ><b>Task planning and scheduling:</b> This feature allows users to create lists of necessary goals and set deadlines for them.  Furthermore, they can break their goals into smaller tasks. Users can also change, delete, or write additional comments, if necessary, for these tasks by using available edit tools of this application. It also makes use of AI technology to automatically categorize the goals, allowing users to use the application in the most convenient and effective manner. Of course, this is an optional feature, and users can disable it if they prefer a manual approach.</li>

        <p style="text-align:center">Source: Todoist</p>


        <li><b>Task priority:</b> My product would include a task prioritization feature to help users prevent wasting valuable resources on less important tasks. Users can mark their goals with different priority levels to avoid situations in which some minor tasks consume too much attention while relevant or really important goals go unachieved. The application will then automatically arrange them at the top of the list in descending order based on the level that the user selects. Additionally, users can set reminders to remind them of the tasks that have been labeled and are coming up to help them stay on schedule.</li>

        <p style="text-align:center">Source: nTask </p>

        <li><b>Reporting:</b> This is another feature that users see tangible progress of their goals. As part of task management, users would need to keep track of and observe the progress of your their activities. In terms of avoiding missing deadlines and make tasks progress more efficiently, it is necessary to control the flow of tasks. In particular, as a result of visual graphs and specific data, users would be updated on their working progress on a daily or weekly basis, see their productivity trends and stay on target to accomplish their goals. Besides, users are able to access the activity history. Specifically, this application would provide users with a task completed archive in case they want to verify if their initial plan was flawed. When users review their process, they can see how small steps can contribute up to big results.</li>

        <li><b>Achievement sharing:</b>	When all of the tasks for a goal have been completed, the system will record the completed goal as a new achievement and save it to the user's account, which they can share with other users. This feature can be used for a variety of purposes. Members of a project team, for example, can share achievements to track their progress, or users can simply show off their accomplishments to friends and motivate them to work harder toward their goals</li>
      </ul>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Tools and technologies</b></h1>
    <hr style="border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-blue"><b>Software</b></h1>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Native mobile development tools:</b> Native development tool is software that enables developers to create applications for a single platform. To begin, Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is used to create software for macOS or iOS. It provides source code for the most widely used iOS programming languages, including Swift and Objective-C, as well as a variety of programming models. In addition, Android Studio (Android) is another ideal tool for mobile application builder. It supports programming languages for Android development such as Java and Kotlin.</li>
        <li><b>Cross-platform development tools:</b> React Native is an cross-platform tools that can be used to create both Android and iOS software. In addition, its flexibility is enhanced by the fact that it can interpret code and convert it into native ones in a short time. Besides, OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is another necessary tool for AI function in this application. It is a collection of programming functions for real-time computer vision and machine learning. It has C++, Python, and Java interfaces and supports both iOS and Android.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I chose these tools for my project because they are both free to use and credible due to their widespread use by high-tech companies around the world.</p>
      <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-blue"><b>Hardware</b></h1>
      <p>A macOS device or Windows device for application developing and mobile phones with latest iOS and Android versions for testing purpose.</p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Skills requirement</b></h1>
    <hr style="border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-blue"><b>Technical skills</b></h1>
    <p>There are three indispensable programming languages used in this project: Python, Java and Swift. In particular, these are used throughout the building and developing process of this application. As a result, being good at these languages are necessary.</p>
    <h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-blue"><b>Soft skills</b></h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Researching:</b> As problem solvers, we should be able to recognize and comprehend the root cause of the problem. Being good at researching skill helps us take advantage of the resources in the most efficiency and also bring for us valuable knowledge during working process.</li>
      <li><b>Analysis:</b> Analytical skills will assist us in understanding problems and developing effective solutions. This skill is also be associated with the researching process to help us differentiate the appropriate approaches and the ineffective ones to identify the most suitable solution.</li>
      <li><b>Collaborating:</b> Teamwork is essential to a successful project. To solve a problem more quickly, we need to work together by sharing our ideas and finding the most optimal approach. Collaborating around each other allows us to achieve our goals much more efficiently than working alone.</li>
      <li><b>Communication:</b> Once we have figured out a solution, knowing how to deliver it to your teammate is also crucial. Explaining a problem clearly will help us reduce misunderstanding and make the implementing process straightforward.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Outcome</b></h1>
    <hr style="border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>If my project is successful in the future, it will make a significant contribution to society. In particular, because everyone's lifestyle will improve in a positive direction, there is no longer a need to worry about managing and distributing work. Specifically, people will become more organized and stay focused with the help of a task management system. Moreover, the productivity of organizations or, more broadly, the industry related to human labor will be improved if each of their individuals knows how to work effectively. As a result, they can provide more qualified products, which is an advantage in the competitive market.</p>
